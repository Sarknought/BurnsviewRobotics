### PID with VEXcode

* [VEXCode V5 Text Tutorials - Autonomous PID and Multitasking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Itn-0d340g)
* [Voltage in VEXcode](https://www.vexforum.com/t/voltage-in-vexcode/61059)

Note that if you're going to try and implement a PID control loop using VEXcode, you'll need to give power to the motors using voltage 
rather than percent or RPM. This disables the integrated V5 motor PID and allows you to use your own PID. There are quite a few resources 
for using PID with VEXcode on the VEX Forums. However, a better option would be to switch to PROS, as it is easier to implement PID with 
PROS rather than VEXcode.
