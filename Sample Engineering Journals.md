Previous engineering journals completed by Burnsview alumni can be borrowed from Mr. Ma by request. These journals, along with those listed
above, should serve as guidelines for what to include in your journal. It's important to have a comprehensive journal that shows both *why*
and *how* you implemented changes in your robot design, code, or game strategy.
